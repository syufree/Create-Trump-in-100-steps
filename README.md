# Infinite Craft NextJS

## Introduction

Welcome to "Infinite Craft NextJS", an experimental project inspired by Neal Agarwal's [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/). This simple yet engaging game combines words to create new ones using ChatGPT 3.5 by OpenAI, built on Next.js. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with ChatGPT and React, featuring dnd-kit for drag-and-drop interactions. This project explores the integration of AI into web apps in a fun way!

Live Demo: [infinite-craft-nextjs.vercel.app](https://infinite-craft-nextjs.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Merge Words in a Snap**: Just drag and drop two words to mash them into something new and cool.
- **Powered by ChatGPT 3.5**: Thanks to OpenAI's tech, get ready for endless word combos that'll surprise you.
- **Dark or Light Mode**: Switch it up to suit your vibe, whether you're a night owl or a daylight lover.
- **Smooth Dragging**: Super easy and slick drag-and-drop action, making mixing words fun and fuss-free.
- **Multiple Word Search Filter**: Can't find your word? No sweat. Sort, search, or filter to spotlight your discoveries or hunt for new ones.
- **Clear and Reset Button**: Messed up or want a fresh start? Hit clear to ditch the current word or reset to wipe the slate clean and begin anew.
